# 🚀 Galactic Ansible Playbook 🌌

Welcome, Cosmic Adventurer! Are you tired of SSHing into servers one by one like it's the Stone Age? Well, you've just hitched a ride on the Ansible Spaceship! 🛸

With just one command, you can perform interstellar deployments, configure celestial bodies (we mean servers, though), and even distribute space cookies (read: software packages) across the galaxy! 🌠

## What Does This Do? 🤷‍♂️

In Earthling terms, this Ansible playbook automates tasks across multiple servers so you don't have to. From installing software to updating configurations, you're now the puppeteer of your own server marionettes.


## 🌍 Universe (Usage)

To command your fleet of servers, you only need a single command. That's right, one command to rule them all!

Here it is, the command of destiny:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i hosts.ini
